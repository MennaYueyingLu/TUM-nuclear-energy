	<p>&#9762 Our project ideation for Web Mapping/Project Map Creation began with choosing our topic. After a few discussions about how we would integrate Europe, we eventually decided that learning about Nuclear Energy in Europe would be an interesting way to show an interesting political debate that is ongoing, current, and could potentially provide insight to future knowledge and decision-making. After choosing the topic, we began initial research for finding data that would provide the fundamentals for our maps. Finding CSV files wasn’t an option we discovered, but we did manage to find currant annual publications of Nuclear Energy reports in order to splice the data into tables that we then integrated with a web map and SVG map, using leaflet as a basis. From there, while collecting data, we created a basic template for the .css document and the introduction .html documents, where we set up the basic web template. Finding the data itself proved to be harder to locate than initially estimated.
	</p>
	<p>&#9762 At this point, we programmed the basic layout and navigation for our webpage. After deciding on this layout as a cohesive basis to be used throughout the assignment, we then created an additional greeting page, to be seen upon first arrival on the site. After a user would reach our site, there is then the initial greeting, where the user then opts in to exploring our site further. This was used through using an SVG polygon to overlay an image which was further imposed on the background, thus creating the desired intrigue to implore further exploration through the website.</p>
	<p>&#9762 From there, we overviewed all of the available data to see what we can exactly portray with our web maps, which ended up being an interesting overview of which countries are currently using nuclear energy, which countries are phasing out of nuclear in their policies, and which countries are buying from others; an interesting statistic to compare between countries “phasing out” and buying more foreign nuclear energy, respectively! The programming at this point become more oriented towards transforming these reports containing data into a .csv and then integrating to our maps. We put placers on an online web map using the coordinate system shown in class in order to show where previous nuclear disasters have occurred, and then showed roll-over statistics for these areas, including a short description. Once the user clicks on one of these markers, information is revealed about the location, time, and a short description about the disaster details. Included on this page is a sliding scale describing the varying degrees of seriousness from these disasters, 7 being the most extreme case, which multiple deaths directly related to an accident, to 1, which is the mildest form of contamination. This sliding scale was designed to go alongside the main web map, and then to default to an underlying position on smaller webpages. After that, we added additional information about certain cons of nuclear energy, focusing on waste disposal- a hot topic of debate when considering the safety of nuclear energy.</p>
	<p>&#9762 The next page we created was the homepage; this is a general layout where we have illustrated icons, created in Photoshop, that enlarge with a rollover to explore the other pages on the site. These contain embedded links with rollover explanatory text to our other pages, which go into further detail about the pros, cons, and additional information about nuclear energy (of course including the diary as well).
One struggle while creating the project was taking these various pages and making them responsive to various page sizes, which at first seems straightforward until trying to integrate this seamlessly with multiple page styles and layouts. After careful checking and trial-and-error sessions, we successfully integrated various page-size formats to account for various potential screen sizes. It was important to be able to account for a small screen size, especially when viewing the more intricate svg  and web maps, where content is typically viewed as an overview before zooming and panning to see smaller details. On other pages, such as the introduction and lower part of the disadvantages pages, content is more easily lent towards .css styles to buffer text blocks, photos, and illustrated icons in order to always consider the most efficient viewing angle with various screen sizes.</p>
<p>&#9762 Following the responsive design aspect, we then decided on a limited color scheme and font family to optimally create a cohesive color-scheme throughout various webpages, regardless of whether those pages integrated maps, illustration, or photography. This should then create a dynamic yet uniform theme for the site which also includes all relevant information on the subject.

	<p>&#9762 To sum up, in the end Ana Carolina and Alika accomplish the 36 hours while Yueying Lu spent 40 hours for the project. </P>
