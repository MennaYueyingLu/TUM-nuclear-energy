	<div class="subtitle">What is Nuclear Energy?</div>
	<p> But what is nuclear energy exactly, and how does it work? Nuclear energy is the process of generating power from the nuclear fission of Uranium, a relatively common element found throughout the world. This Uranium must be mined and processed before being used, and afterwards there is a small amount of waste that is created. This waste is radioactive, and while previously has been frequently stored, there are methods to repurpose this waste and utilize it again for more reactions. This is the process of enriching Uranium.

	<div class="subtitle">Who uses Nuclear Energy?</div>
	<p>Nuclear energy has been in use for over 50 years, and many countries use it to supply a large portion of their power demands. However, other countries such as Germany are now choosing to phase out nuclear energy in exchange for  “greener” options.
	Explore through the various webpages in order to discover some of the key points on both sides of the issue of nuclear power. Valid and strong arguments exist both for and against Nuclear energy, and this site aims to present a few of the main points on either side.
